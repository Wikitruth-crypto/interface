# Cloudflare Pages SPA Redirects
# Redirect routes without file extensions to index.html for client-side routing
# This avoids infinite loops by excluding files with extensions

# Redirect all paths without extensions to index.html
/*    /index.html   200
# But exclude files that already have extensions (js, css, images, etc.)
# Cloudflare Pages will automatically serve these files correctly
